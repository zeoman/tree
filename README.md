# Tree

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## TODO 

Rework from FlatTree to NestedTree and check perfomance
